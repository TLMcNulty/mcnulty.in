    		<h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Former Firefighter/Medic, I don't get to ride on an ambulance anymore. Instead I now fight fires for large technology companies. Some of my favorite work involves DNS, TLS, and perl. I like cars and Captain a team of dedicated guys that race in the 24 Hours of LeMons, for which my role, in addition to management and finances, is fabrication, design, and electronics. I enjoy cooking, and volunteer teaching innovation and sailing.</p>
            <hr />
            <h2>Lemons</h2>
            <p>I'm not sure where a love of cars developed, but I can say the same thing about fire trucks. I enjoyed things like Top Gear, and their story-telling and filmography has influenced a significant portion of my life. Later on I learned about Roadkill, a car show hosted by David Freiburger and Mike Finnegan. They were big proponents of the 24 Hours of LeMons, a parody of the 24 Hours of Lemans, a famous endurance race in Lemans, France. Cars in Lemans are engineering marvels, expensive, and driven by professionals. LeMons is none of that. The limit on a build is $500. The cars are barely held together, and explode regularly. The drivers, amateurs, anyone who can pass tech and keep the car upright. </p>

            <p>It's <i>fantastic</i></p>

            <p>Roadkill struggled to make it to Lemons. It's almost a running gag. I'm not sure how many times they've tried and failed, but they made it once and I think the car exploded and they weren't able to fix it. Among the enthusiast community Lemons is well known, but it's a lot of work to get there. Not many people have enough interest, enough drivers, or enough funds. Somehow we did.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>I grew up reading the Hardy Boys, a series of crime novels starring a pair of sons of a retired police detective. They had a friend, Chet Morton, who was constantly haphazardly showing up with some new and barely working thing that would inevitably end up saving the day. It was a running joke in the stories that Chet was interested in <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Chet_Morton#/List_of_Chet.27s_hobbies">weird and uncommon things</a>. The one I remember best is a jet powered bicycle, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKHz7wOjb9w">something not actually far fetched</a>. Chet also had a run down Jellow Jalopy that was constantly backfiring, and I have way too many decrepit vehicles. I am nowhere near as prolific as Chet Morton but it's been good fun.</p>
            <p>I have an intense love for motorcycles, and own a couple of them.</p>
            <p>I love everything having to do with water. I taught sailing to kids, from 13' Sunfish to 35' Scots and twin hull Hobie 16s. I used to own a number of boats but <a href="https://wtop.com/news/2013/12/photos-boat-comes-off-trailer-on-lee-highway/">they kept meeting interesting ends.</a> It's important to note that I was not actually in the car during that incident, and a friend of mine really enjoyed talking to the reporter.</p>

            <h2>The Future</h2>
            <p>Update: The future got here and it's exactly what I expected; still unknown.</p>
            <p>Recently I've been thinking a lot about what the future holds. Real life is looming ever closer and with it comes a multitude of decisions. I haven't been very many places in the continental United States and don't know where I'd like to life. I love the summer weather in Rochester and the finger lakes, but I'm not sure I can justify the winters. More places to discover I guess. Maybe I should be more concerned with job prospects instead of where I'll end up living. I'm not sure if my parents expect me to move back home. Maybe they're counting on me <b>not</b> doing that. I spend a lot of time thinking about what the future holds. It may be because I'm scared; not of the unknown, but what I think I know. The world is an ever shrinking place, and as we crowd closer and closer together we're going to run out of energy, space, and most importantly, patience. There's a quote by Douglas Adams I like to refer to </p>  
            <figure>
            <blockquote><b>"</b>...on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much — the wheel, New York, wars and so on — whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man — for precisely the same reasons.<b>"</b></blockquote><figcaption style="font-family:Garamond, serif;color:#295a80;font-size:1.3em;">-Douglas Adams <i>The Hitchhikers Guide to The Galaxy</i></figcaption></figure>
            <p>I get a little caught in up this silly world we've created for ourselves in our short time here. We're not going to last. We're not going to make an impact. What we are going to do is spend most of our lives between bursts of happiness, diving back down into the ruts of school, work, love, life, war, and pretty much any other human invention. Why not just treasure our existance for the short time we have it?</p>
