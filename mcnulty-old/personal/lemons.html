    		<h1>Lemons</h1>
            <hr />
            <p>I'm not sure where a love of cars developed, but I can say the same thing about fire trucks. I enjoyed things like Top Gear, and their story-telling and filmography has influenced a significant portion of my life. Later on I learned about Roadkill, a car show hosted by David Freiburger and Mike Finnegan. They were big proponents of the 24 Hours of LeMons, a parody of the 24 Hours of Lemans, a famous endurance race in Lemans, France. Cars in Lemans are engineering marvels, expensive, and driven by professionals. LeMons is none of that. The limit on a build is $500. The cars are barely held together, and explode regularly. The drivers, amateurs, anyone who can pass tech and keep the car upright. </p>

            <p>It's <i>fantastic</i></p>

            <p>Roadkill struggled to make it to Lemons. It's almost a running gag. I'm not sure how many times they've tried and failed, but they made it once and I think the car exploded and they weren't able to fix it. Among the enthusiast community Lemons is well known, but it's a lot of work to get there. Not many people have enough interest, enough drivers, or enough funds. Somehow we did.</p> 
            
            <p>In 52 days I rallied 8 guys to buy a car, gut it, fix the engine, make some basic mods to the exhaust and fuel system, and add a host of safety equipment. The last week we worked 7 days straight until 2am in a dirty garage, after working our full time jobs. We decided on a 2001 Ford Focus. We bought it from a small dealership, with the cars stored at a house. For $100 we got a small economy car, with an inline 4 engine that probably made close to a hundred horsepower after traveling most of the way to the moon. </p>
            
            <p>Lemons requires a number of safety modifications to the cars, the most important and obvious being a roll cage. A roll cage is an additional internal skeleton to a car, it's designed to keep the body of the car from folding in on itself during a roll over. Just as an aside, if you roll during a race, you're out for a year. The kill switch has to shut the engine off and keep it off, even if the engine is rolling over three thousand RPM. It's not difficult to keep the engine running off just the alternator at that speed. You need a fire hydrant within reach, safely secured. The seat has to be within X number of inches from certain points of the car. The list goes on to cover fuel and restrains, as well as a number of protective items required for drivers.</p>
            
            <p>I don't remember a lot from the first couple days. The race seemed so far away, I was happy to leave the car in the condition it was in after stripping, but I handed it to the guys I put in charge of performance. Matt and Blair. They went over the thing like a couple of monkeys, ripping this out, saying that needed to be replaced. The car has rear drum brakes and we spent a number of dirty hours pulling everything we needed to convert them to discs. Matt thought at first when we were looking at the car that the clutch was slipping. You'd put your foot down and the car would lurch back like the engine was revving ahead of the rest of the system. It was later determined that the engine was misfiring, we left the clutch and it performed fine. Solving the misfire took a significant amount of time. The car had been overheating like crazy and that was on the list of things to solve. Running theory was that the heat had warped the head of the engine and it needed a head gasket. We had to pull the head off and send it for decking and pressure testing. If the pressure test came back bad, that means it had bent so much that the valves weren't sealing in their seats. Luckily decking it solved the issue. We pulled the radiator and had to replace it after the old one starting growing something. All of this together solved the overheating and the slipping issue.</p>
            
            <p>I have to give a lot of credit to Dave. Dave is the welder we found on Craigslist. Dave had never seen a roll cage, let alone put one together but he happily accepted the task of putting our poorly fitting cage together. He was less than happy he had accepted the job when it was turned over to us, but he pulled through and did a fantastic job. His welds are the prettiest thing on that car. We were up there the better part of a week helping him clean metal, take measurements, and tack things together. It was an exciting day we got that care back. It was a real race car.</p>
            
            <p>The 2018 Dodge SRT Hellcat make 808 Horsepower. It has a 6.2-liter V8 engine married to a 2.7-liter supercharger. The car comes standard with drag radial tires and comes with 2 different keys, one black, and one red. </p>
            <p>The 2018 Dodge Hellcat is a fast car. It is named after something that will <i>rip off your face,</i> but the inside of a Hellcat does not feel ravenous or as insane as the specifications would lead you to believe. There's a lot of leather, many computer screens. The cabin is insulated and climate controlled. It's comfortable. When you sit down and turn the key of a stock Hellcat you may feel a rumble and hear the engine, but you have to remind yourself, this is a fast car.</p>
            
            <p>The 2001 Ford Focus made 130 Horsepower from the factory. It has no computer screens. Its 5 speed manual version did not have a transbrake, or a limited slip differential.</p>
            
            <p>The 2001 Ford Focus was not a fast car, and cars do not age like wine. It's not named after anything really terrifying at all unless you're a 3rd grader with ADHD. Stepping into a stock Focus is not unlike stepping into a stock Hellcat. Stepping into <i>our</i> Focus is different. I have to put you into a five hundred dollar suit designed to sustain flames. You have to strap your helmet to your chest, and your chest to the roll cage. We have a shirt that pumps cool water around your core to keep you cool, the climate is far from controlled inside our racecar. There's a crew chief in your ear, we strap a radio to your shoulder. Our 2001 Ford Focus is not a fast car, but you do not have to remind yourself that it'll kill you if you don't respect it.</p>
