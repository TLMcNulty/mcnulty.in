                <h3>autohammer</h3>
                <p>At athena the Linux Systems Engineering team is responsible for building and adding capacity to the infrastructure. We used to have a cobbler set up that we interacted with through the command line, and during my days as an intern I wrote a utility that would construct cobbler commands for an entire HP ProLiant chassis, up to 16 blades. This utility ran out to the OOB management interface for the chassis and pulled needed information from the blades, compiled it with addresses it found free in a defined network space, and calculated hostnames based on the athena convention from user defined arguments.</p>
                <p>After a lot of movement towards a RedHat Satellite implementation, but a departure from the suggestion method of configuring your network with Satellite, the team was left with a less than optimal way of building machines. We regularly add vast amounts of capacity to an environment that we don't consider made of pets. Quickly and efficiently adding capacity is must, and we lost some of that. A co-worker built a tool he referred to as hammertime, due to it's wrapping of the tool Satellite uses at its core, Foreman and Hammer. You supplied it with a hostname, address, host id, and it build you a machine. autoHammer takes a a bare minimum amount of information and constructs hammertime commands for as many servers as you'd like.</p>

                <h3>Racing Intercoms</h3>
                <p>Lemons safety regulations require teams to have contact with the drivers. They specify that a pit board, a simple board with the ability to snap numbers or messages to is fine. I've wanted to build a set of helmet mounted intercoms for a while now, mostly for use on motorcycles during group rides. My vision was a typical cheap Baofeng VHF radio, with adaptations; a microphone in the chin guard, speakers in the ears, and a Push To Talk (PTT) button in the glove. Easy to hear, cheap, ergonomic. Simple electrically, and adaptable. It was something I was excited to build, and it was exactly what we needed over a pit board.</p>

				<h3>athenahealth Development Suite Build-out</h3>
            
				<p>Currently I'm responsible mainly for triage of internal incidents to the platform and its infrastructure after initial contact by the NOC. Over the past year I've personally added significant amounts of capacity during and through a RedHat Satellite implementation. I'm quickly becoming a source of expertise in the implementation of SSL/TLS at athena, strengthening my perl development skills, and mastering complex apache troubleshooting. My favorite protocols are DNS, DHCP and TLS.</p>
            
				<p>As the Network Engineering team built out new protocols and infrastructure for newer and more exciting <a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/athenahealth-incentivizes-employees-to-use-disaggregated-network/2017/08/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_treasury%3Bd9su73MbSV2EAN91z8JyZA%3D%3D">data center implementations</a>, like spine and leaf and white-box hardware, I was tasked with moving significant numbers of infrastructure across geographies (the hall) and technologies. Luckily at athena we have a highly dependable Data Center team and I didn't have to wrangle any machines myself, but I wrote and maintained utilities that made the entire process of conversion and safe movement of over 150 machines encompassing almost the entire development infrastructure. After identifying maintenance windows for the machines that were affected, I wrote a suite of scripts that re-bonded the interfaces to allow for virtual tagging of VLANs. Trunking VLANs to the host was one of the goals of this project as it would free the network team from flipping ports when we needed to "move" machines across isolated networks. This has however caused problems with our multicast ganglia network and our ability to use our RedHat Satellite implementation to its fullest extent, but those are problems we work towards minimizing every day. The utilities written for this project were able to be rebuilt for like applications in legacy areas of the network, as well as general housekeeping you're able to do during big downtime like this</p>

				<h3>CallBoard</h3>
				<p>Automatic and autonomous 911 page display.</p>
				<p>CallBoard was a nifty little piece of software I worked on with a friend and coworker of mine during my time at <a href="http://ambulance.rit.edu">RIT Ambulance</a>. It was designed to accept serial dumps out of a Critical Response M1501 Digital Pager and clean the information for display and notification to responders. Over the course of a few years the system went from text only to colorized and accessible over the internet. Ultimately it notified dozens of people about hundreds of emergencies reliably and at a low cost using Amazon Web Services Simple Notification Service.</p>
