    		<h1>Tom McNulty</h1>
            <p>Curiousity drives understanding, understanding fuels innovation. I'm curious about most things, understand many, and innovate on a few. I help adminstrate a large Linux infrastructure at athenahealth, captain a team of guys that race cars with the 24 Hours of LeMons, and teach an after-school program designed to build and develop innovation and entrepreneurial skills in children.</p>

            <h2>Writing Prompt: Seek Those That Ride</h2>
            <p>Growing up I lived in Washington, D.C. in the heyday of WMATA's metro. The public transit system has suffered greatly in recent years but while I was little I would travel all over the district with my elderly neighbor, Anne. She would take me to the Zoo or my favorite Italian delicatessen, which I make sure to visit every time I return home. Very often did Anne and I find ourselves on a red tiled platform under one of Harry Weese's distinctive arches. The center platform stations were my favorite.</p>

            <h2>24 Hours of Lemons</h2>
            <p>Got to write some stuff about this.</p>
            <hr />
            <h2>Adventures in Turkish Propaganda</h2>
            <p>Sometime last year the Turkish Cyber group <a href="https://www.ayyildiz.org/#">Ayyıldız Tim</a> took advantage of a vulnerability in my hosting provider and wiped my site from the servers, replacing it with some untranslatable animated single page website that rotated through glamour shots of soldiers and heart wrenching pictures of little girls crying. I was a little peeved at all this but for the most part it was my own fault for not personally checking the integrity of the systems I used. I didn't really consider the site important enough to back up as I had copies of the framework, but I've put it back up now and want to fill it out a little more.</p>
            <hr />
          <h2>CallBoard V.1 Released!</h2>
            <p>After saying I'd do this for a year I finally got around to building my paging system. Read about it on <a href="https://github.com/TLMcNulty/CallBoard#callboard">Github</a> or go into more detail on the <a href="projects.html">projects page.</a></p>
            <hr />
            <h2>Why this site?</h2>
            <p>Well besides being required as a part of my course work, I built the collection of McNulty.in pages as an excercise in web development. You can find examples of experimentation in animated GIFs, Webm embedding, Javascript and JQuery, SQL connection, and a host of other things I'm not very good at, but tried anyway.</p>
