    			<h1>Radio Intercoms</h1>
				<hr />
                <p>Lemons safety regulations require teams to have contact with the drivers. They specify that a pit board, a simple board with the ability to snap numbers or messages to is fine. I've wanted to build a set of helmet mounted intercoms for a while now, mostly for use on motorcycles during group rides. My vision was a typical cheap Baofeng VHF radio, with adaptations; a microphone in the chin guard, speakers in the ears, and a Push To Talk (PTT) button in the glove. Easy to hear, cheap, ergonomic. Simple electrically, and adaptable. It was something I was excited to build, and it was exactly what we needed over a pit board.</p>
              <p>The Baofeng UV-5R is an inexpensive, handheld, dual-band FM transceiver. It uses a K1 speaker/mic pinout.</p>

              <p>This circuit is simple and easily modified. It didn't take long to extend leads from an existing speaker mic to a glove button and to relocate the microphone and speakers. The first version prototype was simply that, the board was tucked into the helmet and wires ran down to a K1 connector. It worked decently for the first race but the car wasn't on the track enough to really merit significant amounts of communication. Version 2 was planned to use a pit crew headset as a test platform. I found some ear protection online with speakers and an aux jack, the plan was to split the speakers off the radio and put them into the ear protection, and attach a small boom mic to the casing, and run that back into the handset. Something like this.</p>

              <p>This looked great but was unfortunately a total failure. The radio did not have enough power to drive the speakers in the headset. I needed to amplify the signal and I only had something like 6 days. That's not enough to get a <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/987">tiny amplifier board</a> and build an untested circuit from scratch. I needed a quick and dirty version to prototype with. I had a guitar amplifier for use with headphones that had an aux input. I rewired the connectors to the radio to go into the amplifier, which meant I had to rewire the rest of the circuit, which meant adding the PTT button there.</p>
