        <h1>Resume</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>At the highest level I want to improve access to technology and improve quality of life. This doesn't always mean improving wealth or eliminating disease, though both are very worthy pursuits. I like to think societally, changes to how humanity might think about finance or understand relationships. I'm a big fan of Mitchel Resnick at <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/lifelong-kindergarten/overview/">MIT's Lifelong Kindergarten Lab.</a> I really enjoy urban planning and infrastructure projects like the Big Dig and <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Freeway_removal#/Projects">other freeway removal projects</a>. I think cities should be for people and that they change the landscape of a country.</p>
        <p>I am a strong leader and enjoy motivating passionate people. I used to run <a href="https://apps.rit.edu/studentaffairs/studenthealth/rita/">the collegiate EMS program at RIT</a>, serving as President; which included conflict resolution, event planning, financial management, professional communication, and community outreach. In June of 2017 I gathered a team of guys who successfully <a href="https://mcnulty.in/personal/lemons.html">converted a passenger car to race ready</a>. The project initially spanned 52 days and all told encompassed over 15,000 dollars and hundreds of man hours spent in an often dark garage after work. Tempers often ran hot and a lot was on the line, but the team made it and there is more work to do and more races to enter.</p>
        <p>I enjoy beer, hardware prototyping, electronics, storytelling, and furthering my lackluster web development skills.</p>

        <p>When I joined athena the company was in flux. A new CTO had been brought on and my team, engineering triage, had just been created. Over the course of my first couple months my co-workers and I developed systems for the rapid intake and triage of work entering the engineering team. The goal being to minimize interruptions of unplanned work to more senior engineering resources.</p>
        <p>Projects included: 
        <ul>
        	<li>Re-architecting multiple internal SSL configurations</li>
            <li>Quickly patching 154 SSL certificates after chrome deprecated some surprise stuff</li>
            <li>Enabling datacenter teams to begin doing hardware replacements hands-off</li>
            <li>Owned the movement of over 100 servers to a new datacenter suite with new network architecture. My scripts and procedures allowed the datacenter engineers to once again do this with no hands on from administrators.</li>
            <li>Securing servers and services</li>
            <li>Writing and developing spec testing for our puppet implementation</li>
            <li>Writing and maintaining tools to administrate our DNS system from the command line</li>
            <li>Writing and maintaining tools that wrap our hammer/foreman implementation, taking a lot of manual labor out of system builds.</li>
		</ul>
        Other day to day responsibilities included:
        <ul>
        	<li>Maintaining DNS</li>

        <h3>athenahealth</h3>
        <h4>Production Systems Intern<br />
        June 2015 - August 2015</h4>
        <p>My time as an intern saw the development of a tool that allowed efficient system builds, a precursor to the hammer wrapper I wrote when I returned, as well as the consolidation of a split and duplicated puppet codebase, and the design and implementation of NetApp Harvest, for the gathering of metrics from our netapp filers.</p>

        <h3>Chili Fire Department</h3>
        <h4>Driver - Interior Firefighter - Volunteer<br />
        September 2014 - May 2016</h4>
        <p>Chili allowed me to fulfill a dream I'd had since I was a boy. The biggest thing I learned as a Firefighter with Chili Company 4 was the immense amount of respect I have for the work of public safety personnel and my chief. I am immensely grateful for every second I had at Chili.</p>

        <h3>RIT Ambulance</h3>
        <h4>Public Relations Director - Driver - Medic - Trainer - President<br />
        September 2012 - May 2016</h4>
        <p>RIT Ambulance (RITA) made me the person I am today. Whereas I'd been historically insubordinate and rebellious towards authority the agency at RIT taught me the true strength of a team and what it means to follow, and what it means to lead. Without RITA I would not be the listener I am, I would not know what it means to stick up for your guys, and what it means to be stuck up for.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>DataSol</h3>
        <h4>Systems Engineer<br />
        November 2013 - August 2016</h4>
        <p>DataSol provided managed services to medium and large businesses. As a systems engineer I was responsible for system builds for clients, as well as front line help desk and the administration of Windows Server and Exchange.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Arlington Educational Television</h3>
        <h4>Producer<br />
        September 2011 - August 2012</h4>
        <p>AETV was the culmination of many years of television production work at the Arlington Career Center. As a producer I was handed client requests for video work or productions and managed a team ranging from just myself to two others until a deliverable product.</p>
